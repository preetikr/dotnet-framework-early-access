# .NET Framework 4.7.1 Early Access

This repository is the home for [.NET Framework Early Access Program](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/07/welcome-to-the-net-framework-4-7-1-early-access). It provides you with  all the information you need to participate in .NET Framework Early Access Program.

The .NET Framework 4.7.1 is the next version of the .NET Framework. It is currently feature-complete and in the testing phase. We are asking for individuals and companies to help validate the quality and compatibility of the release. It is not ready for production and is not supported.

## More Information on the Program

.NET Framework Early Access builds are primarily intended for developers and operations folks who want to validate that their apps are compatible with new .NET Framework versions. These builds can also be used to try out new features.

The .NET Framework early access builds will replace any existing .NET Framework 4.x installation on your machine. This means all .NET Framework 4.x applications on your machine will run on the .NET Framework early access builds upon installation. That's great for testing, but a potential problem for production workloads (at this stage in the release).

These builds are not yet stabilized, so are not supported and not recommended for production deployment. They are intended only for use in testing environments. You can uninstall early access builds, however, you should only install these builds in disposable environments like virtual machines.

We typically ship pre-release builds for .NET Framework releases to get early feedback. You can see pre-release builds for the past few releases: [4.6.2](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/03/30/announcing-the-net-framework-4-6-2-preview/), [4.6.1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2015/10/29/announcing-net-framework-4-6-1-rc/), [4.6](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2014/11/12/announcing-net-2015-preview-a-new-era-for-net/). There was no pre-release build for the .NET Framework 4.7. We intend to move to a model where we ship pre-release builds more often to get feedback earlier.
